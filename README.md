## Mother Acebook

This was a two week project during week 8-10 @ Makers. We were tasked to create a web application with similar functionalities to that of Facebook. Our group decided to choose the Java pathway, the tech stack we used was Java with Springboot and React, we learnt all these technologies in less than 10 days from scratch.
